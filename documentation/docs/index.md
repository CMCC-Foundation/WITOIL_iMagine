# Welcome to Medslik-II documentation page

WITOIL for iMagine is an application to run enhanced oil spill simulation at the iMagine marketplace, by using MEDSLIK-II, starting from either a shapefile or a point source spill.

The oil spill model code MEDSLIK-II (De Dominicis et. al 2013, Part 1 and Part 2), based on its precursor oil spill model MEDSLIK (Lardner and Zodiatis 1998; Lardner et al. 2006; Zodiatis et al. 2008) is a freely available community model and can be downloaded from this website. It is designed to be used to predict the transport and weathering of an oil spill, using a lagrangian representation of the oil slick.
